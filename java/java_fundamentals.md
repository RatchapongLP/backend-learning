# Java

## General Facts
- First version released in $1995$
- Initially developed by Sun Microsystems. In $2010$, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems, including Java platform. 
- Compiled code (byte code) is not machine-executable, need to be translated again into machine code
- Platform independent compiled code (C, C++ need different compilers for OS's)
- Platform dependent runtime (C, C++ don't need runtime)
- Object-oriented language
- Familiar to C syntax

## Java Development and Execution
### Java byte code
- Instruction set meant for execution by JVM

### JVM
- Required for running byte code
- Platform dependent
- Contains byte code loader, verifier, interpreter, and Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler
    - **Interpreter** executes byte code instructions directly, translating byte code (.class)
      line-by-line into machine code, and hand it to the OS.
    - **JIT compiler** detects frequently executed sections of byte code (hotspots) at runtime,
      pre-compile them into machine code in advance before the line is reached by the interpreter,
      and place them in the memory for ease of access. This resulting in better performance compared
      to using interpreter alone.

### JRE
- Required for running Java applications
- Platform dependent
- Includes JVM
- Contains Java standard libraries
- Language agnostic: can run Groovy, Scala, Kotlin

### JDK
- Required for Java development
- Platform dependent
- Includes JRE
- Contains tools and utilities for development, compiling, packaging, distribution, etc.

### Pros and Cons of JVM model
#### Pros
- Platform independent compiled code
- Secure: JVM acts as a sandbox. It establishes boundaries between the code and the machine,
preventing the code from accessing or manipulating dangerous parts of the machine.

#### Cons
- A bit slow start up due to line-by-line interpretation (compensated with JIT optimization after start up)

### GraalVM
- GraalVM is a full-scale JDK distribution that follows the JVM specification and offers more.
- GraalVM JDK can simply be used as a drop-in replacement for other JDKs.
- Offers two ways of optimizing JVM (refer to the [official link](https://www.graalvm.org/why-graalvm/)) as:

1. #### Option 1: running compiled byte code using GraalVM as VM
- It uses the Java HotSpot VM as platform.
- GraalVM replaces the last-tier optimizing compiler in the HotSpot JVM (C2) with the Graal compiler, 
which includes several new optimizations. 
- GraalVM is itself written in Java (in contrary to Java Hotspot VM which is written in C, C++) 
which accelerates maintenance and delivering new optimizations.
- Several companies, such as Oracle Cloud, Twitter, and Facebook are running large-scale Java applications 
on GraalVM JDK to increase performance, reduce resource usage, and lower deployment costs. 

2. #### Option 2: running native executables compiled with 'Native Image'
- Native Image is a GraalVM tool that convert byte code into native executable of Java applications, 
that are self-contained and thus no longer require the JVM. 
- The image generation process employs static analysis to find all code reachable from the main Java method 
and then performs full ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. At build time, it also performs snapshotting, 
so, at run time, the application starts much faster with pre-populated heap. 
- The resulting native binary contains the whole program in machine code form that is ready for 
execution instantly at startup with the following features:
  - Instant startup due to pre-initializing the JDK and user code at build time
  - Reduced memory and CPU usage due to minimized code execution overhead
  - Small packaging due to the AOT approach and slim runtime components
  - Reduced attack surface due to code elimination and the AOT approach



## Java Core

### General Facts
#### `public static void main(String[] args)`
Special method declaration that is recognized as the entry point for Java program.

#### `var`
- `var` can only be used for local variables, including loop variables in enhanced for loops and 
  resource variables in try-with-resources statements. It cannot be used for fields, method parameters, 
  or method return types.
- A `var` declaration **must** be initialized at the time of declaration.
- Java compiler automatically **refers** the variable's **static** type at **compile time** based on the 
type of the initializer expression assigned to the variable.

### Primitive Types
- **Integers:** `byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long`
- **Floating Points:** `float` and `double`
- **Character:** `char`
- **Boolean:** `boolean`

#### `byte`
- $8$-bit signed two's complement integer
- The leftmost bit (bit #8) - a.k.a. most significant bit (MSB) - determines whether the number is positive or negative.
  If MSB is $0$, the number is positive or zero. If MSB is $1$, the number is negative.
- The rest of $7$ bits makes up the number's absolute value.
- For positive numbers, the $7$ bits are interpreted straightforwardly.
- For negative numbers, the $7$ bits are stored in a special way of signed two's complement.
  1. Take the absolute value of the number.
  2. Convert this absolute value to its binary representation.
  3. Flip all the bits (change 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s) â€“ this is called the one's complement.
  4. Add 1 to the result.

  Example, to find the two's complement of -5: 
  1. Absolute value: 5
  2. Binary of 5: 00000101
  3. One's complement (flip bits): 11111010
  4. Add 1: 11111011.
```
jshell> Integer.toBinaryString(5)
$1 ==> "101"

jshell> Integer.toBinaryString(-5)
$2 ==> "11111111111111111111111111111011"

#### `boolean`
- Two possible values: `true` and `false`
- JVM encodes boolean array components using $1$ to represent `true` and $0$ to represent `false`. 
- Compilers map boolean values to JVM type of int.
- Literals: `true` and `false`

#### Strongly static typing
- The declared variable's type and the assigned value's type should be *compatible*.
- Typically, smaller-capacity source can be converted to larger-capacity destination.
```
// This is fine because int can be converted to double
int i = 123;
double d = i; 

// This is not fine
double d = 10; 
int i = d;
```
- For smaller-capacity destination, it is incompatible and therefore needs casting.

#### Casting
- An unary operator used for explicit type conversion
- Has the syntax of `(<destination_type>) <source>`
- Java can squeeze certain sources into the destination to make it work even if 
it is not ideal, causing **lossy conversion**.
- Throws an exception at runtime when the runtime cannot 'make it work'
```
// Lossy conversion, works but not accurate
double d = 10.5;
int i = (int) d; // Get i = 10
```

#### Precision Loss
- Sometimes, the assigned source are detected as compatible with the destination
but it actually is **not**.
```
int i = 3 / 2; 
double d = 3 / 2; 

// i = d = 1 because 3 / 2 is an (int / int) which cannot hold fractions, 
resulting in a 1
```

#### Automatic Type Promotion
- In an expression with multiple types, the smaller-capacity types are all converted
to the largest-capacity type of the expression.
```
double d = 10;
int i = 5;
var c = d * i 
// c becomes a double
```



### Arrays
- Array's size is static. Once created, its size cannot be changed.
- Cannot be cast from one type of array to another.
- Array Initializer is a shorthand for creating an array at the declaration point:
```
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
```
- For multi-dimension array initialization, one must specify the size of the first 
dimension at least. This allows multi-width columns or jagged array.
```
int[][] nums = new int[2][];
nums[0] = new int[4];
nums[1] = new int[3];
// nums = { {0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0} }
```



### Variable Memory Allocation
- Primitive types are allocated with some space of the type's size 
instantly at the variable declaration.
- Arrays, Strings and Objects are allocated with space of the reference only, 
at the variable declaration, then the actual space for the objects are allocated
later when the variable is instantiated or initialized. 



### Operators
#### Arithmetic Operators
- Binary Arithmetic Operators (require two operands): `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`
- Unary Arithmetic Operators (require one operand): `!`, `+`, `-`, `++`, and `--` 
(post/pre increment/decrement or postfix/prefix operators)

#### The Equality and Relational Operators
- `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=`
- `instanceof` - type comparison operator  (`null` is not an instance of any types)

#### The Conditional Operators
- `&&`, `||`, and `?:`

#### Bitwise Operators
- Performs a logical operation on each corresponding bit of two operands.
- Mimics boolean as 1 for `true` and 0 for `false`.
- **Caveat**: all the bit wise operators automatically promote `byte` and `short` to `int` before
  performing operations.<br>
    ##### Operators
- Bitwise AND (&): If both bits are 1, the result bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
- Bitwise OR (|): If at least one bit is 1, the result bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
- Bitwise XOR (^) (exclusive OR): If the bits are different, the result bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
- Bitwise NOT (~): Flips the bits of a single operand. Every 0 becomes 1, and every 1 becomes 0.
```
byte a = 0b1010;
byte b = 0b1001;
// a & b = 0b1000 = 8
// a | b = 0b1011 = 11
// a ^ b = 0b0011 = 3

// ~a != 0b0101  
// ~a = 0b1111_0101 = -11

// TODO: why these two methods of finding the value of negative integer from two's complement representation
yield the same results?
method 1: "minus 1 from a, negating, interpret value, then add minus sign" (reverse engineering storing negatives from positives)
method 2: "negating, adding 1, interpret value as a positive integral, then add a minus sign" (chatGPT)

proof:
case 1: 10...0 (n number of 0)
  method 1: 01...10 -> 10...01 -> (binary stored of a negative) -> 01...10 is the positive -> 2^n - 2 -> 2 - 2^n
  method 2: 01...1 -> 10...0 -> looping
```

#### Bit Shift Operators
- `<number> << <shift_positions>` - signed left shift: shift the binary pattern of the `<number>` 
to the left for `<shift_positions>`, replacing vacant positions on the right with `0`.
```
jshell> Integer.toBinaryString(8)
$1 ==> "1000"

jshell> Integer.toBinaryString(8 << 2)
$2 ==> "100000"
```
- `<number> >> <shift_positions>` - signed right shift: shift the binary pattern of the `<number>`
to the right for `<shift_positions>`, replacing vacant positions on the left with the sign bit.
```
jshell> Integer.toBinaryString(8 >> 2)
$3 ==> "10"

jshell> Integer.toBinaryString(-8)
$4 ==> "11111111111111111111111111111000"

jshell> Integer.toBinaryString(-8 >> 2)
$5 ==> "11111111111111111111111111111110"
```
- `<number> >>> <shift_positions>` - unsigned right shift: shift the binary pattern of the `<number>` 
to the right for `<shift_positions>`, replacing vacant positions on the left with `0`.
```
jshell> Integer.toBinaryString(-8 >>> 2)
$6 ==> "111111111111111111111111111110" 

// Only 30 digits is displayed above
// Check if the replacing digits were 0 or not

jshell> String s = "00" + Integer.toBinaryString(-8 >>> 2)
s ==> "00111111111111111111111111111110"

jshell> Integer.parseInt(s, 2) == (-8 >>> 2)
$8 ==> true

jshell> Integer.parseInt(s, 2)
$9 ==> 1073741822

jshell> -8 >>> 2
$10 ==> 1073741822
```

#### Assignment Operators:
- `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `^=`, `|=`, `<<=`, `>>=`, `>>>=`



### Blocks and Variable Scoping
- Variables exist from where they are declared and end when the end of scope is reached.
- Scopes are bound by curly braces `{}` or blocks.
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
  {
    int i = 1;
  }
  System.out.println(i); // This does not compile
}
```


#### Switch statement
- Regular switch statement: 
  - need `break` to stop fall-through.
  - cases can be grouped together.
```
int a = 3;
switch (a) {
  case 0:
    System.out.println("a == 0");
    break;  
  case 1:
    System.out.println("a == 1");
    break;  
  case 2, 3, 4:
    System.out.println("1 < a < 5");
    break;  
  default:
    System.out.println("other");
}
```
- Switch expression: 
  - `->` eliminates the need for explicit `break`, preventing bugs.
  - `yield` for returning values in case blocks.
```
int a = 3;
String result;
result = switch (a) {
    case 0 -> {
        result = "a == " + 0;
        yield result;
    }
    case 1 -> {
        result = "a == " + 1;
        yield result;
    }
    case 2, 3, 4 -> "1 < a < 5";
    default -> "other";
};
System.out.println("The result is " + result);
```


### For-Each Loop
- Has the following syntax:
```
for (Type elementVariable : iterableOrArray) {
    // Stuff
}
```
- Can be used with `Iterable` objects or arrays.
- Internally uses an `Iterator` for `Iterable` objects.
- Does not allow modifying the `Collection` object during iteration, or else it throws `ConcurrentModificationException`. 
For such operations, use an Iterator explicitly instead.



### `null` exactly
- The `null` expression that belong to a special *null* type, which has no name. 
- Because the *null* type has no name, it is impossible to declare a variable of the *null* type 
or to cast to the *null* type. 
- The `null` reference is the only possible value of an expression of *null* type. 
- The `null` reference can always be cast to any reference type. 
- In practice, the programmer can just pretend that `null` is merely a special literal that can 
be of any reference type.
- See more on `null` at this [Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2707333)
